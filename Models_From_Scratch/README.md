# Models From Scratch
In this section of the repository, I solidify my understanding of the machine learning algorithms (my notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ayhem18/Towards_Data_Science/tree/main/Machine_Learning)) by building models from scratch using Octave and Python programming languages.
## Section structure:
* AD + RS: a folder with an anomalie Detector built on normal probability and a recommender system based on collaborative filtering.
* K-means + PC: implementing the K-means clustering algorithm as well as Priciple components analysis reduction techniqu
* Linear_Regression: implementing both univariate and multivariate regression as well as its extended polynomial version
* Logistic_Regression: implementing Logistic Regression, polynomial Logistic Regression and Multi-class LR using the one versus all technique.
* SVM: coding the RBG kernel and building a simplistic Spam classifier based on the built-in package for SVM in octave

### Note
The octave implementations are extensions of the assignments provided by the original Stanford online Machine Learning course lead by Andrew Ng.
