    "* The variate is generally defined as a linear combination of other independent variables with an emperically calculated weights. So, basically a variate can mathematically expressed as follows:\n",

    "$$ Variate = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\cdot x_i$$\n",

    "    * Nominal: usually present the presence of absence of a characteristics: It is simply nonsensical to determine the ***amount*** of such variable.\n",
    "    * ordinal: higher precision. This variable can have only few possible values where only the order relationship is known but no quantitive difference can be estimated. Such variables can have $4$ possible values: $A, B, C, D$ where $A > B > C> D$. However, expressions such as $A - C$ do not hold any intrinsic meaning or anlytical value.  \n",

    "    * Interval: The difference can be estimated. Nevertheless, there is no absolute zero point. Most importantly, the ratio operation is not necessarily sensical. \n",
    "    * ratio: Quite similar to the `interval` measure but with all mathematical operations valid.\n",
