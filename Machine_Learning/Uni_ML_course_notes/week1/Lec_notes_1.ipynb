    "* Machine Learning algorithms are computer programs that improve performance at some task through experience.\n",

    "    $\\begin{align}E(y_0 - \\hat f (x_0))^2 = Var(\\hat f (x_0)) + Bias(\\hat f (x_0))^2 + Var(\\epsilon)\\end{align}$\n",

    "As Variance and Bias and inheritedly negatively correlated, the best result that can be achieved is generally a tradeoff between both quantities."
