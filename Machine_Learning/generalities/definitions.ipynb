    "## Machine Learning\n",
    " \n",
    "### Old definition by Arthur Samuel\n",
    "Machine Learning: a field of study that focuses on the providing computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Recent Definition by Tom Mitchell \n",
    "For a learning-problem P, the program is said to learn from Experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some preformance measure **P** if its performance on **T** , as measured by **P** improves with **E**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "#### Informal\n",
    "An algorithm falls in the category of supervised learning if the provided data set is labeled. In other words each data is associated with\n",
    "a value or a right answer. The algorithm is expected to predict these values for new values. More formally, the labels/values are referred\n",
    "to as ***features***. \n",
    "#### Regression VS classification\n",
    "if the features represent a finite set of values. They the problem is a *classification* problem. \n",
    "On the other hand, if the features are numerical values that do not fall in a finite predetermined set of values, then the problem is\n",
    "a *regression* problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "An algorithm falls in the category of unsupervised learning if the provided data set lacks a clear, predefined structure. The algorithm is expected to classify, group, structure the data. Among the main unsupervised learning algorithms, we can find clustering algorithms."
