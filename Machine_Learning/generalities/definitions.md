## Machine Learning
 
### Old definition by Arthur Samuel
Machine Learning: a field of study that focuses on the providing computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

### More Recent Definition by Tom Mitchell 
For a learning-problem P, the program is said to learn from Experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some preformance measure **P** if its performance on **T** , as measured by **P** improves with **E**.

### Supervised Learning
#### Informal
An algorithm falls in the category of supervised learning if the provided data set is labeled. In other words each data is associated with
a value or a right answer. The algorithm is expected to predict these values for new values. More formally, the labels/values are referred
to as ***features***. 
#### Regression VS classification
if the features represent a finite set of values. They the problem is a *classification* problem. 
On the other hand, if the features are numerical values that do not fall in a finite predetermined set of values, then the problem is
a *regression* problem


### Unsupervised Learning
An algorithm falls in the category of unsupervised learning if the provided data set lacks a clear, predefined structure. The algorithm is expected to classify, group, structure the data. Among the main unsupervised learning algorithms, we can find clustering algorithms.
