The training data set should be proprocessed to contain images with only one of the classes in question. The labels vectors would be created as follows: \n",

    "Sliding Windows is one of the first techniques used to detect an object's presence in a picture. First, train a Neural network to detect the object in question. The first data set is usually centered arouond the object. In other words, A car detection system would be first fed a large number of pictures with a car covering the vast majority of the picture.  \n",
    "The second step is to consider a small box and slide each one of them on the training data set.  At each slide/iteration, the box crops an image that is fed to the original neural network.  \n",
