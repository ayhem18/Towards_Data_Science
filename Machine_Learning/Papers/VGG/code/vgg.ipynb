    "The most special thing about the [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) architecture is its simplicity. It emperically proved the significance of depth of Neural Networks. \n",
    "Theoretically, there is not much to say about the paper. Nevertheless, I would like to use the main idea to create my own shallower version of VGG architectures and experiment with them on simpler problems / datasets. "
