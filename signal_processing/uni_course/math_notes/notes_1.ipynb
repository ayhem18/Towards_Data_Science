    "* A general definition of a signal processing is analysing time-variant physical processes. The latter can be either continous or digital. Digital Signal processing is the result of simplifying the signal to a sequence of values at well-known discrete points in time.\n",
    "* Roughly speaking, A signal processing system is any system that receives discrete-time signals and outputs other discrete-time signals after certain manipulation\n",
    "* amplitude is the actual value associated with the sinus / cosine wave\n",
    "* magnitude it the absolute value of the amplitude\n",
    "* For a system $S$ to be linear, if $S(x_1) = y_1$ and $S(x_2) = y_2$, then $$S(c_1 \\cdot x_1 + c_2 \\cdot x_2) = c_1\\cdot y_1 + c_2\\cdot y_2$$\n",

    "* so what is periodic sampling ? It is the process of representing a continous signal as a discrete sequence of values where each value is extracted after a specific period of time.\n",
    "* The question associated with sampling is: how well does the discrete sequence represent the original signal.\n",
