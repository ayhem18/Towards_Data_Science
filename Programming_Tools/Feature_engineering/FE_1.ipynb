    "Feature engineering is the art (yes art) of manually creating new features to feed to the model with the goal of boosting performance. In this notebook, I will explore (and save) a number of general and well-known techniques.\n",

    "* Kaggle [course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)\n",

    "Having a large number of features might be extremely overwhelming. Thus, the first step is to reduce the available set of features into a smaller one that might serve as a starting point to build a powerful prediction model. Later, more features can be incorporated in the process.\n",

    "In simple terms, MI reflects the extent to which the knowledge of one variable (feature) reduces the uncertainty of another (target).  \n",
    "On a technical note, MI is based on information technology measurement refferred to as ***entropy***. The larger the entropy, the more uncertain the variable is, (the less correlated / tied to each other)."

    "* Each feature is evaluated separately. In other words, a feature might quite powerful when combined with other features. Yet, it might not as significant on its own\n",
    "* A high MI score reflects a **potentially** useful feature. A transformation such as log, exponential, polynomial might be needed to take see the relationship between the target and the feature.\n",
