    "Well, first assuming the existence of a basis of $n$ vectors. then a tensor of rank $m$ is a quantity that is defined by $n^m$ components. Generally this quantity represents a phenomena that can be mathematically modeled by $m$ different vectors. Each component represents a scalar associated with a combination among the possible combinations of choosing $n$ directions (from the basis vectors) $m$ times with repetition.  \n",
