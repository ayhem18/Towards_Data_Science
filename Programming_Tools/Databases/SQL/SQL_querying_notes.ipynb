    "* The result can be further accessed as follows: SELECT * FROM view_name;\n",

    "* Conditions can use arithmetic operators such as '=' for equa, and <> for not equal.\n",
    "* WHERE col <= a and col >= b  $\\iff$ WHERE col between a AND b \n",
    "* We can use the following to filter text data:\n",
    "    1. _ matches a single character, % match any number of characters.\n",

    "### Aggregating: Group BY\n",
    "* I would like to think of **GROUP BY** as follows: this command creates a number of temporary tables internally where each table have a unique value of the column (or combination of columns) used to group. \n",
    "* Having this in mind, the query can return any of the fields used for grouping, or the result of an aggregating function applied over the values of the other fields in each temporary table. \n",
    "* IF a filtering condition is set on a result of aggregate function, it requires the use of the keyword HAVING.\n",
    "* THIS is mainly explained by the order of execution as FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING: so WHERE is called before the groups are created and thus no filtering based on the results of aggregation can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The following question poses itself: how to filter the aggregated results. Well the **WHERE** clause would not work here. This is why we use its equivalent clause **HAVING**. The latter can filter the results by two means:\n",
    "    1. operators on one of the columns used for grouing as they are integrated in the internal temporary tables\n",
    "    2. operators on an aggregate functions on any column \n",

    "\n",
    "### Distinct\n",
    "* Well the **DISTINCT** keyword is usually associated with aggregation.\n",
    "* SELECT DISTINCT col_1, col_2 ..., col_n FROM table: returns each unique value in the table in a separate row. \n",
    "* THE SELECT DISTINCT col_1, DISTINCT col_2 does not compile when the number of distinct values in the two columns differ. (which makes sense as SQL works only with non-ragged tables)\n",
    "* The main application of DISTINCT is with the COUNT clause: getting the number of unique values per groups.\n",
    "* It is important to note that DISTINCT will sort the data internally (simple DSA knowledge), thus it slows the query's performance significantly.\n",
