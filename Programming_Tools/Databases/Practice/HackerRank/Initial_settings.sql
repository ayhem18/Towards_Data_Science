-- THIS SCRIP IS WRITTEN TO CREATE THE DIFFERNT SCHEMAS I WILL USE TO SOLVE CODING CHALLENGES ON THE DIFFERNT CODING PLATFORMS
-- SUCH AS sql_zoo, hacker rank 

-- ON HACKER RANK PLATFORM, the challenges share the same table requesting queries with different level of difficulties.
-- I will create a different schema for each family of challenges, as a number of the advanced problems might require creating
-- temporary tables to solve
