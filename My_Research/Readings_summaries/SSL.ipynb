    "\n",
    "* The paper builds on top of a key observation: Training a head classifier on top of a randomly initialized convolutional neural network reaches an accuray of $12\\%$ which is huge relatively to the expected probability of a random classifier: $\\frac{1}{1000} = 0.1$ The latter is an emperical evidence of the extreme discriminative power of convolutional layers. \n",

    "1. Given a feature extractor with fixed weights $\\theta$, we find the cluster centroids as well as assign a cluster (and thus a label) for each sample.\n",
    "2. Given these pseudo labels, we train the classification head and the entire network with backpropagation."
