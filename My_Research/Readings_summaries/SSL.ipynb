    "    $$L = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{m=1}^n \\sum_{i=1}^C L(y_i^m f_i^m) + \\alpha(t) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^{'}} \\sum_{m=1}^{n^{'}} \\sum_{i=1}^C L(y^{'m}_i, f^{'m}_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* This loss is somehow equivalent to cross entropy regularization, as the $y^{'m}_i$ is the most probable label at the given iteration.\n",
    "* choosing the proper scheduling $\\alpha(t)$ is crucial to take advantage of the unlabeled data without disrupting the training with the labeled one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The paper above explains that increasing $\\alpha(t)$ mitigates the erros at the early training stages."

    "* This paper introduces clustering into the self-supervised learning picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The paper builds on top of a key observation: Training a head classifier on top of a randomly initialized convolutional neural network reaches an accuray of $12\\%$ which is huge relatively to the expected probability of a random classifier: $\\frac{1}{1000} = 0.1$ The latter is an emperical evidence of the extreme discriminative power of convolutional layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The general idea is quite simple: iterative training\n",
    "1. Given a feature extractor with fixed weights $\\theta$, we find the cluster centroids as well as assign a cluster (and thus a label) for each sample.\n",
    "2. Given these pseudo labels, we train the classification head and the entire network with backpropagation."
