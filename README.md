# Towards_Data_Science
## 1. Repository's Description
This repo was created as a mean of tracking and saving the knowledge I acquire throughout my learning journey towards my dream data job. (either Machine Learning engineer or Data scientist !!). The notes shared here are from different sources:
* Online Courses
* My [university](https://innopolis.university/en/) courses
* Youtube channels
* Books and research articles.  
Feel free to read, share the repo and most importantly report any errors / bugs you might possibly find (well starring the repo is definitely appreciated)

## 2. Repository's Structure:
The repo constitutes of 4 main  folders:
1. Machine_Learning: This folder includes theoretical explanations,  practical tips and possible applications of the machine learning algorimths I learnt.
2. Mathematics: This folder includes my own notes on the mathematical branches needed for a deeper understanding of the Data Science field. It includes mainly:
    * Optimization
    * Linear Algebra
    * Probability theory
    * statistics
3. Programming_Tools: This folder saves my experiments with different related programming tools. They serve as references for best practices and general usage.
4. ds_env: This folder is a Python virtual environment storing the last versions of the packages used in the repo including:
    * [scikit-learn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-scikit-learn-on-linux/)
    * [numpy](https://www.code-learner.com/how-to-install-numpy-on-macos-linux-and-windows/#:~:text=Open%20a%20terminal%20and%20run%20the%20command%20%24,or%20install%20multiple%20packages%20at%20the%20same%20time.)
